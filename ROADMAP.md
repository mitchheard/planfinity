# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the planned direction for Planfinity.

## Now (MVP Stabilization)

- Improve UX clarity for placement and removal actions.
- Add quick presets for common drawer and container setups.
- Expand test coverage for edge-case placements and baseplate slicing.

## Next (v0.2.x)

- Drag-and-drop placement interactions.
- Container rotation support (90 degrees).
- Multiple saved layouts per browser (local-only).
- JSON import/export for layout sharing.
- Prompt-based AI layout suggestions (for example: "I want to store pliers, screws, and drill bits") that propose container mixes to fill the drawer.

## Later (v0.3.x+)

- Smarter baseplate planning and packing suggestions.
- Rich container catalog management.
- Print/material/time estimation helpers.
- Optional cloud sync and account features.
